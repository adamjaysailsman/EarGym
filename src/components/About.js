      <h1> The Art of Ear Training </h1>
      <p>
        Ear training or aural skills is a music theory study in which musicians
        learn to identify pitches, intervals, melody, chords, rhythms, solfeges,
        and other basic elements of music, solely by hearing. The application of
        this skill is analogous to taking dictation in written/spoken language.
        As a process, ear training is in essence the inverse of sight-reading,
        the latter being analogous to reading a written text aloud without prior
        opportunity to review the material. Ear training is typically a
        component of formal musical training and is a fundamental, essential
        skill required in music schools.
